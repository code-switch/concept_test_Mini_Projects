# concept_test_Mini_Projects
1) These projects reflects the work on core machine learning concepts from scratch i.e. implementation of some machine learning algos that are easily customizable and showing the background working of these algos.
2) One can go through these projects to get the insight of ML algos conceptually.
3) These Algos are just for study purposes but might not be as efficient as the standard ML frameworks/libraries/packages available(for obvious reasons) for real world applications.
4) Every project is self explanatory from its naming. It is adviced to google the name for standard ML implementions to know more detailed know how in parallel to reading these project codes for better understanding.
